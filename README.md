# ‚öõÔ∏è‚ö° WhatsApp Floating Button Component for React

## Description

This React component offers an elegant WhatsApp floating button, serving as a bridge to the official WhatsApp application. It simulates a WhatsApp chat interface, allowing users to initiate conversations directly from your website. Upon clicking "submit," users are redirected to WhatsApp with their message pre-filled, ready to continue the conversation. Ideal for enhancing customer support and engagement, this component simplifies the transition from web inquiries to WhatsApp communication using WhatsApp's API.

## Screenshots

The WhatsApp Floating Button Component supports both light and dark modes, ensuring it can integrate seamlessly with your application's theme. Below are the mockups for each mode:

### Development and Testing Files

The following files are intended solely for development and testing purposes and do not form part of the component's distribution:

- `<root>/index.html` (used to test the component)
- `<root>/src/**/*` (excluding `<root>/src/lib/**/*` which is the component)
- `<root>/public/` (used to test the component)
- `<root>/preparePublish.js` (prepares the component for npm publishing)

## Building and Testing the Package

**Note**: For anyone that just want to get and use the component, the [Installation](#installation) and [Usage Example](#usage-example) sections have got all you need üëçüèª.

This section is for developers who want to modify the component. Follow the steps outlined below to rebuild and test your changes locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js (version 18 or higher) installed on your system. This project employs `pnpm` for efficient dependency management. If you don't have `pnpm`, install it with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**: Get a copy of the project onto your local machine by cloning the GitHub repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CarlosUlisesOchoa/react-whatsapp-floating-button.git
    cd react-whatsapp-floating-button
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Use `pnpm` to install all the necessary dependencies. This ensures your environment is equipped with everything needed for building and testing the component.

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

### Running a Local Development Server

You will be able to modify and see real-time changes due we are using Vite to dev and deploy.

You can run:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Now you will be able to start enhancing or customizing this beautiful but always improveable component üòÅ.

### Rebuilding the Library

Execute the following command to build the library:

```bash
pnpm run build:lib
```

This script performs a series of tasks:

- Clears the `dist` directory for a clean build.
- Adjusts TypeScript configurations for the build.
- Compiles the library using Vite into the `dist` folder, which will contain the production-ready code.
- Resets TypeScript configurations after the build.

That's it. Now you can take a look at the ```dist``` directory where you'll find the bundled code.
